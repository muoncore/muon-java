# Muon Core - NodeJS


NodeJS implementation of Muon, a polyglot microservices communications framework. Why? Because RPC/HTTP/REST are terrible protocols for microsrvices and encourage trnasactional behaviour. Muon is a polyglot, multi protocol, high opinionated, inter-communicaiton API for microservices that encourages developers to design application in a CQRS style. Muon handles discovery and message delivery via configurable transports. Muon currently supports RPC, Streaming, eventing, and Pipelining protocols (think posix pipes, one way messaging passing, what Alan Kaye originally intended when he was thinking about OO). TODO: Blockchain, Machine learning protocols.





# Examples

You'll need RabbitMQ running for transport, try running our demo VM over here preconfigured for this demo: https://github.com/muoncore/muon-dev-vm


open a terminal and run the exmaples service:

```
node examples/muon-dev-tools-server.js

```



now open another terminal window and run a client to test some of the exmaple services:


### echo service

this exmaple service endpoint echos back it's given payload.

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-echo-client.js
```


### ping service

This example service responds to a payload with contents 'ping' with a 'pong' message.

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-ping-client.js
```



### random number service

Generates a random number between 10000 & 99999.

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-random-client.js
```


### type id service

identifies the javascript type of the payload and responds back.

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-type-client.js

```




### uuid service

Generate a uuid

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-uuid-client.js

```
